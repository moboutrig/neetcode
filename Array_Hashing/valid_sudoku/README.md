## Features
- Validates whether a given 9x9 Sudoku board is correctly filled.
- Uses efficient tracking arrays to ensure each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 sub-box.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Go installed. If not, download and install it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-solver-go.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd sudoku-solver-go
   ```
4. Build the executable:
   ```
   go build
   ```
5. Run the program:
   ```
   ./sudoku-solver-go
   ```

## Usage
The program validates the provided Sudoku board and outputs whether it is valid (`true`) or not (`false`). Modify the `main` function in `main.go` to use different Sudoku boards if needed.

## Algorithm Explanation
```go
Start
|
V
Initialize tracking arrays for rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes to keep track of numbers seen
|
V
For each row i from 0 to 8:
|   For each column j from 0 to 8:
|   |
|   V
|   If board[i][j] is not '.', indicating it has a number:
|   |
|   |   Calculate num as the number in board[i][j] adjusted to zero-based index
|   |   Calculate boxIndex to identify the 3x3 sub-box containing board[i][j]
|   |
|   |   If num is already marked in rows[i], cols[j], or boxes[boxIndex]:
|   |   |
|   |   V
|   |   |   Return false, indicating the board is not valid (duplicate found)
|   |   |
|   |   Else:
|   |   |
|   |   V
|   |   |   Mark num as seen in rows[i], cols[j], and boxes[boxIndex]
|   |   |
|   V
|
V
Return true, indicating the board is valid (no duplicates found)
|
V
End
```

## Example
Consider the following Sudoku board:
```
5 3 . | . 7 . | . . .
6 . . | 1 9 5 | . . .
. 9 8 | . . . | . 6 .
------+------+------
8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3
4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1
7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6
------+------+------
. 6 . | . . . | 2 8 .
. . . | 4 1 9 | . . 5
. . . | . 8 . | . 7 9
```
Running the solver on this board should output:
```
true
```
